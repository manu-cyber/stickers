# My 36c3 stickers

These files have been used to generate printing files for my 36c3 stickers. The designs have been created using [Bleeptrackâ€™s 36c3 generator](https://36c3.bleeptrack.de/). They are [free for you to use](./LICENSE).

The font used by the generator is [Marvel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marvel), so you need to install it for proper editing.

These files still contain the boxes for cutting and clearance for printing at Flyeralarm. I chose the 6,8 x 2,1 cm format with rounded corners. The alignment of the text has been improved from my printed versions slightly, and the green did not really pop with the Flyeralarm result. It might use some brightening up, depending on the printer.
