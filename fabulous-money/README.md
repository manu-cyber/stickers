# If money can't buy happiness, then why is it so fabulous?

I designed this sticker after a quote from [Poppy’s song “Money”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp_Ku8XUpTwa).

The font in use is [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) but I included a version where the fonts have been converted to pahts.
